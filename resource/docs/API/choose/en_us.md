### CyberFurry
This isn't necessarily bad news - using `CyberFurry` offers several advantages:

- Pre-trained `Furry`-specific model with authentic furry persona simulation
- Excellent role-playing capability
- Unlimited API usage (once approved)
- Fast response times with no AI model timeouts

However, some limitations exist:

- Complex API application process for `CyberFurry` series (*we provide proxy API access*)
- Specialized for furry content with limited general-purpose capabilities
- Potential limitations in English language support

Despite these limitations, we currently recommend using the `CyberFurry` model for its relatively good performance and hassle-free experience. Most importantly:
